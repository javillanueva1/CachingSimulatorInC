CachingSimulatorInC
===================

This is a collection of files which will simulate 4 different caching algorithms: Second Chance, Least Frequently Used (LFU), Least Recently Used(LRU) and Random. These are all powered with a deque as the backbone data type. All files are written in C.

The programs which simulate these different algorithms are named 2Chance.c, lfu.c, lru.c, random.c
In each of the directories,there is a file that can be used for testing named accesses.txt.
There are more testing files found in Makefiles, Compiled Programs and Texts
